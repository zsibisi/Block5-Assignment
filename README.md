   The Zoo Problem - Project
   On this project we are creating a web-page for the Wild Animal Mini-Zoo. They're recently hired many new zookeeper interns who will work at the zoo for the next six months. They have contracted my team to build a page that will make it easier for the new interns to identify each animal and understand their needs and behaviors. The page was created using html and using the following requirements.
   
1.  Incorporating major HTML semantic tags, i.e., header, footer, article, section, and summary.
2. Created a main header of what this page will do.
3. Adding a title for the browser tab.
4. Adding  a heading for each animal type. There are five types of animals.
   1. Bears
       Ollie
       Mona
   2. Giraffes
       Frankie
       Coconut
   3. Lions
      Mella
      Karl
   4. Monkeys
     Cookie
     Earl
     Banana Pudding
   5. Alligators
      Wren
      Aspen
      Mika
5. Adding the names of each animal in a list format.
6. Adding a description for each animal and use a paragraph, section, or article tag.
7. Create a link for each animal that goes to an external fact page of that particular animal so the zookeeper can quickly find out more information. These external    pages can link to other outside websites.
8. Add a photo for each animal.
